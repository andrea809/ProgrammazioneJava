# Takamaka: Smart Contracts in Java


Takamaka is a Java framework for writing smart contracts.
This means that it allows programmers to use Java for writing code
that can be installed and run on blockchain. Programmers do not
deal with the storage of objects in blockchain: this is completely
transparent to them. This makes Takamaka completely different from other
attempts at using Java for writing smart contracts, where programmers
must use specific method calls to persist data on blockchain.

Writing smart contracts in Java entails that programmers
do not have to learn yet another programming language.
Moreover, they can use a well-understood and stable development
platform, together with all its modern tools. Programmers can use
features from the latest versions of Java, such as streams and lambda
expressions.

There are, of course, limitations to the kind of code that can
be run inside a blockchain. The most important limitation is
deterministic behavior, as we will see later.

# A First Takamaka Program

Let us start from a simple example of Takamaka code. Since we are
writing Java code, there is nothing special to learn or install
before starting writing programs in Takamaka. Just use your
preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. Or even
do everything from command-line, if you prefer. Our examples below will be
shown for the Eclipse IDE.

Let us hence create an Eclipse Java project `takamaka1`. Add
a `lib` folder inside it and copy two Takamaka jars inside `lib`.
Add them both to the build path. The result should look
similar to the following:

Let us create a package `takamaka.tests.family`. Inside that package,
create a Java source `Person.java`, by copying and pasting
the following code:

``` java
package takamaka.tests.family;

public class Person {
  private final String name;
  private final int day;
  private final int month;
  private final int year;
  public final Person parent1;
  public final Person parent2;

  public Person(String name, int day, int month, int year, Person parent1, Person parent2) {
    this.name = name;
    this.day = day;
    this.month = month;
    this.year = year;
    this.parent1 = parent1;
    this.parent2 = parent2;
  }

  public Person(String name, int day, int month, int year) {
    this(name, day, month, year, null, null);
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return name +" (" + day + "/" + month + "/" + year + ")";
  }
}
```
